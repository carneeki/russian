# Noun cases

Cases are how the noun is used in a sentence. In the Duolingo Russian course,
there are six cases covered:

1. Nominative - the subject of a sentence
1. Accusative - direct objects
1. Genitive - ownership of an object
1. Prepositional - used after some kind of logic, such as "if"
1. Dative - indirect objects
1. Instrumental - to show use of an object

There may be other cases too, I am yet to encounter them and I have not yet
finished the course.

## Nominative

This is the case you will find in the dictionary for a noun.

Nominative is also the easiest case to understand, for a simple sentence in
English it is typically the first noun in the sentence. The structure generally
follows the form `subject`-`verb`, or `subject`-`verb`-`object`.

* "**Mark** is eating.", **Mark** is in the nominative case and the subject
of that sentence.

[Grammar Monster's Nominative Case](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/nominative_case.htm)
is a good guide on the nominative case in English.

### Nominative in Russian

Nominative cases in Russian are similar to that in English, and follow the same
`subject`-`verb`, or `subject`-`verb`-`object` structure.

* **Марк** есть, **Mark** is eating.
* **Марк** есть торт, **Mark** is eating a cake.

Nominative cases are explored in more detail in the page [01 Basics 1](castle_1/01_basics_1.md)

## Accusative

The accusative case is typically at the end of a simple sentence English.
For a simple sentence with two nouns and some kind of action (verb) being
done to one of the nouns, the accusative case is the noun which is being
acted upon.

* "Mark is eating a **cake**", the cake is being acted on by Mark.

[Grammar Monster's Accusative Case](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/accusative_case.htm)
is a good guide on the accusative case in English.

### Accusative in Russian

In Russian the accusative case can sometimes change the word ending with a
different suffix.

* Марк есть **торт**, Mark is eating a **cake**.

## Dative

The Dative case shows the indirect object of a verb, that is to say some
sentances will have be of one of two forms:

* `subject`-`verb`-`object`-`indirect object`
* `subject`-`verb`-`indirect object`-`object`

Some examples:

* Mark is preparing a cake for Holly.
* Mark prepared Holly a cake.

In both examples, `Mark` is the subject, `preparing`/`prepared` is the
verb, `cake` was the direct thing, and `Holly` was indirect, so Holly is
the Genetive case.

is a good guide on the accusative case in English.

## Genitive

The Genitive case shows ownership or posession of a noun by or to another noun.
In English this is denoted in one of several ways:

1. Apostrophe s: "Mark**'s** cake."
1. "of": "The hole *of the donut*" or "Edge *of the table*"
1. "my", "your", "our": "**My** bicycle.", "**Your** stuff", "**Our** teacher"

### Genitive in Russian

## Prepositional

Prepositions are used to describe a location or position of a thing compared
to another thing. It takes one of two forms:

1. `main thing`-`preposition`-`other thing`
1. `preposition`-`other thing`-`main thing`

* "The icing is **on** the cake."
* "**On** the cake is the icing."
* "The jam is **inside** the donut."
* "**Inside** the donut is the jam."
* "The cafe is **behind** the bank."
* "**behind** the bank is the cafe."

Prepositions can also be used to describe the timing of one thing in relation
to another thing. In timing, it has the same forms as location.

* "I went to the bank **before** going to the cafe."
* "**Before** going to the cafe, I went to the bank."

## Instrumental

Instrumental case is when we use a thing to perform an action, where that
thing is an instrument to perform the action. Instrumental case takes several
forms in English, often the words "using", "with", or "by/by means of a"
are good indicators of the instrument:

* "Using a"-`instrument`-`action`
* `subject`-`object`-`action`-"using a"-`instrument`

* "Using a **knife**, Mark cut the cake."
* "Mark cut the cake with a **knife**", **knife** is in the instrumental case
