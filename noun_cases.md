# Noun cases

Cases are how the noun is used in a sentence. In Russian, there are six cases:

  1. Nominative - the subject of a sentence
  1. Accusative - direct objects
  1. Genitive - ownership of an object
  1. Prepositional - used after some kind of logic, such as "if"
  1. Dative - indirect objects
  1. Instrumental - to show use of an object

## Nominative

### Plain English Explanation

This is the case you will find in the dictionary for a noun.

Nominative is also the easiest case to understand, for a simple sentence in
English it is typically the first noun in the sentence. The structure generally
follows the form `subject`-`verb`, or `subject`-`verb`-`object`.

**Mark** is eating, **Mark** is in the nominative case and the subject of that
sentence.

### Nominative in Russian

Nominative cases in Russian are similar to that in English, and follow the same
`subject`-`verb`, or `subject`-`verb`-`object` structure.

* **Марк** есть, **Mark** is eating.
* **Марк** есть торт, **Mark** is eating a cake.

## Accusative

### Accusative Plain English Explanation
In English, this case is typically at the end of a simple sentence English. For
a simple sentence with two nouns and some kind of action (verb) being done to
one of the nouns, the accusative case is the noun which is being acted upon.
Mark is eating a **cake**, the cake is being acted on by Mark.
