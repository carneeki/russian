# Russian Notes
## Introduction
This repository is a collection of notes from my attempt to learn Russian
using Duolingo.

I have found the 'tips and notes' within Duolingo to be somewhat lacking,
and the forums to be of limited use given there (at time of writing) is
not a great guide to understanding some of the terminology used in the
forums.

The forum posts I *did* understand were fantastic, and I thoroughly
commend the efforts of volunteers like `Shady_Arc`, spending much time
to help others.

## Course Structure
Duolingo has appeared to structure the classes as follows. Each topic
consists of 5 levels of proficiency, and each level has a number of
lessons, some classes have as few as 4 lessons, others have as many as 9,
with about 6 or 7 lessons being the norm.

Topics are grouped into "Castles" or checkpoints which seem to be
arbitrary checkpoints to encourage continuing.
