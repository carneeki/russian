# Noun genders

cf <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language#Grammar>

Nouns get divided into categories called "genders". I find it easiest to think
about genders as just being some arbitrary category based on the last few
letters of the word. There are 3 genders of nouns.

| Gender | Endings |
|--|---|
| Masculine | Any consonant, -**й** -**ь** |
| Feminine | -**а**, -**я**, -**ь** |
| Neutral | -**о**, -**е**, -**ё** |

## Gender `-ь`

Because the `-ь` stem can be either masculine or feminine, some additional rules
are needed to help decide. The suffix is a special type of stem, we start with a
base word and put a suffix on the end. Not all stems are a suffix, for example
гость (guest) is not a suffix, there is no 'base word' that the suffix is
glued onto.

### Gender `-ь` :: Masculine rules

* -**тель** suffixes are masculine. eg:
  * учи**тель** :: teacher, comes from `учи́ть` (to teach) + -**тель**
  * строи**тель** :: builder, comes from `строи(ти)` (to build) + -**тель**
  * писа**тель** :: writer, comes from `писа́ть` (to write) + -**тель**
  * It is important to note that the `-те́ль` stem is different to `-тель` suffix so
    * ме**те́ль** - blizzard is feminine
* -**арь** suffixes are masculine:
  * ‎апте́к**арь** :: pharmacist, comes from `апте́ка` (pharmacy) + -**арь**
  * слов**арь** :: dictionary, comes from `сло́во` (word) + -**арь**
  * техн**а́рь** :: technician, comes from `те́хника` (technology/engineering) + -**арь**
  * календ**арь** :: calendar, comes from Polish.
* Any month of the year ending in `-ь` is male
  * январ**ь** - January
  * феврал**ь** - February
  * апрел**ь** - April
  * июн**ь** - June
  * июл**ь** - July
  * сентябр**ь** - September
  * октябр**ь** - October
  * ноябр**ь** - November
  * декабр**ь** - December

### Gender `-ь` :: Feminine rules

* Most abstract nouns (that is things which are not physical, such as "night").
  * There are some exceptions, день is masculine, but ночь is feminine.
* -**ость** suffixes are feminine, and are usually abstract nouns
  * ‎ста́р**ость** :: old age, comes from `ста́рый` (old) + -**ость**
  * ли́х**ость** :: bravery, comes from `лихо́й` (brave) + -**ость**
  * ‎гла́сн**ость** :: openness, comes from `гла́сный` (open) + -**ость**
  * ра́д**ость** :: joy, comes from `ра́д` + -**ость**
* -**есть** suffixes are feminine (mostly)
* Nouns with a sibilant (`ess` / `sh` / `ch` type sound) and then -`ь` are feminine.
  * но**чь** has a "ch" sound, so it follows the sibilant rule

### Gender - plurals

In addition, there variations to the genders:

  1. Plural
  1. Informal
  1. Formal
