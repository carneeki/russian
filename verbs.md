# Verbs (actions)

Verbs can be divided into one of two categories, called an "aspect". There are
two aspects:

  1. Imperfective, an action done or may be ongoing.
  1. Perfective, an action done in the past, usually with a phrase like
  "should have", "must have", or "might have".

## Imperfective Aspect

The imperfective aspect descibes an aspect that has not yet been completed.

## Perfective Aspect

An action that has been completed.
