# Verbs (actions)

Verbs can be divided into one of two categories, called an "aspect". There are
two aspects:

  1. Imperfective, an action done or may be ongoing.
  1. Perfective, an action done in the past, usually with a phrase like
  "should have", "must have", or "might have".

## Imperfective Aspect

The imperfective aspect descibes an aspect that has not yet been
completed. They can be one of several tenses, present tense, or future
tense. Inside both of present and future tenses, depending on who is
performing the action, a verb may also be:

  1. 1st singular (I - Я)
  1. 2nd singular (you - ты)
  1. 3rd singular (he/she/them - он/она/оно)
  1. 1st plural (we - мы)
  1. 2nd plural (you - вы)
  1. 3rd plural (they - они)

### Imperfective present tense

Imperfective present tense verbse use a postfix (a stem stuck on the end) as
of indicating who is performing the action. The base example,
`to walk` - `ходить` is used here.

| Who | Postfix | Usage | English | Notes |
|-----|-----|-----|-----| --- |
| 1st singular | `-` | я хожу́ | I walk | It is common to say "Я иду", the postfix is a special case. |
| 2nd singular | `-ишь` | ты ходишь | You walk | |
| 3rd singular | `-ит` | он ходит | He walks | |
| 1st plural | `-им` | мы ходим | We walk | |
| 2nd plural | `-ите` | вы ходите | You walk | |
| 3rd plural | `-ят` | они ходят | They walk | |

### Imperfective future tense

Imperfective future tense verbs rely on a postfix on the pre-word `буд-`
to indicate the verb is set in the future, and takes a similar postfix to
the present tense, but is not always the same. The base example,
`to walk` - `ходить` is used here:

| Who | Postfix | Usage | English | Notes |
|-----|-----|-----|-----| --- |
| 1st singular | `-у` | Я буду ходить | I will walk | |
| 2nd singular | `-ешь` | Ты будешь ходить | You will walk | |
| 3rd singular | `-ет` | Он будет ходить | He will walk | |
| 1st plural | `-ем` | Мы будем ходить | We will walk | |
| 2nd plural | `-ете` | Вы будете ходить | You will walk | |
| 3rd plural | `-ут` | Они будут ходить | They will walk | |

## Perfective Aspect

An action that has been completed.
