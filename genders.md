# Nouns
## Genders
Nouns get divided into categories called "genders". I find it easiest to think
about genders as just being some arbitrary category based on the last few
letters of the word. There are 3 genders of nouns.

  1. Masculine
  1. Feminine
  1. Neutral

In addition, there variations to the genders:
  1. Plural
  1. Informal
  1. Formal

## Cases
Cases are how the noun is used in a sentence.

  1. Nominative - the subject of a sentence
  1. Accusative - direct objects
  1. Dative - indirect objects
  1. Genitive - ownership of an object
  1. Instrumental - to show use of an object
  1. Prepositional - used after some kind of logic, such as "if"

# Verbs (actions)
Verbs get a category called an "aspect". There are two aspects:

  1. Imperfective, an action done or may be ongoing.
  1. Perfective, an action done in the past, usually with a phrase like
  "should have", "must have", or "might have".
